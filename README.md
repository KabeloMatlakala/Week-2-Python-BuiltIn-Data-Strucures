## Introduction

In this repository, we explore and practice the use of Python's built-in data structures through various exercises. These data structures are foundational to understanding Python programming and solving problems efficiently.

## Files

- `week_2_python_data_structures.py`: The main Python script that contains the exercises.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Exercises

Here are the key exercises covered in this repository:

1. **Working with Lists**:
   - Appending elements to a list.
   - Inserting elements at specific positions.
   - Removing elements from a list.
   - Sorting and slicing lists.
   
2. **Working with Tuples**:
   - Accessing tuple elements.
   - Understanding immutability.
   
3. **Working with Sets**:
   - Adding elements to sets.
   - Checking for uniqueness and unordered behavior.

4. **Working with Dictionaries**:
   - Storing key-value pairs.
   - Accessing, adding, and modifying dictionary entries.
